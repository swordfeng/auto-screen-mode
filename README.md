auto-screen-mode
===
Switch between multi-monitor modes (Extend, Clone, Internal, External) when detecting USB connection/disconnection.

Used for my KVM switch setup - One screen switching between multiple devices, while the other wired to Windows PC.
When the other device is used, I want my Windows PC to use the single monitor.

Just too lazy to not hard coding the USB device vendor, product and screen modes.
